# Summary and Repo Address

This is a program which calculated a student's weighted average for CSC 212 by using the student's grade in each
category as well as the weight of each category as a part of the entire grade. The output of the program is both
A numerical representation and the letter grade corresponding with it.

# Documentation

### Course
Course is a class that helps store and calculate information about the grades in a given course  
`Course::task_list`  
Contains all task objects under the command of course. See [Task](#Task)  
`Course::NAME`  
The name of the course (possibly useful for indexing a list of classes)  
`Course::DESC`  
A description of the course, useful for displaying info on multiple courses  
`Course::weight_achieved`  
A float, should usually exist on the domain [0,1] although it is worth noting that higher grades may be able to be achieved in classes that offer extra credit  
`Course::calc_grade()`  
Returns a float that contains your grade/100  
`Course::calc_grade_letter()`  
Returns the corresponding letter grade to the number returned by `Course::calc_grade()`  
`Course::add_task()`  
Appends a new task to the list  
`Course::add_grade()`  
Adds achieved weight to a task. See [Task](#Task)  
`Course::get_num_grade()`  
Returns the product of the weight and 100

### Task
Task is a container for all info about what the courses are and what grades they have  
`Task::weight`  
Contains the amount of weight a grade will recieve  
`Task::grade_list`  
Contains a list of every grade in a category  
`Task::grade`  
Contains a float value that represents the grade of an assignment  
`Task::name`  
Holds the name of the Task  
`Task::description`  
Holds a desciption of the Task for the user  
`Task::Task()`  
Assigns a name, description, and weight to a Task object

### How to Compile
For the actual percentage representation for each category, the user needs to hard code their grade for each category before compiling.
When compiling, you need to type 'g++ main.cpp Course.cpp Task.cpp'
To execute, type './a.exe'
There is no additional input needed because the current grade of the student is hard coded.
The final grade and letter grade equivalent will be provided as output.
