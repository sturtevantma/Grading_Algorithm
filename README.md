Pseudocode for course.cpp:

class Course {
private:
  int grade
  String letter
  double weight
  Vector<Task> taskVec
  
  public:
  
  Course(String Name, String desc)
  
  
  double calcGrade(name)
  //Calculate grade based on tasks
  if name = "homeWork"
      Calculate grade
  
  String Name()
  //Get name of the course
  this->name = name
  
  int weight_achieved()
  //Find weight achieved based on weight for task
  
  
  String addTask(String name, String desc, double weight)
  //Add Task name to Task Vector
  
  
  int add_grade()
  //Get grade
  
  int calcGradeLetter()
  //Find grade letter based on percentage
  if grade >= 90 
      letter = "A"
  if grade >= 80 and grade < 90 
      letter = "B"
  if grade >= 70 and grade < 80
      letter = "C"
  if grade >= 60 and grade < 70
      letter = "D"
  if grade < 60 
      letter = "F"
